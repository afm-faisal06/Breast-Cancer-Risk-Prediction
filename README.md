# Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using XGBoost and Random Forest Algorithm
The project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of breast cancer. Through careful data analysis, preprocessing, and model training, various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are employed. The dataset is comprehensively explored, and features are standardized to ensure model consistency. Model performances are rigorously evaluated using metrics like confusion matrix and accuracy score, providing insights into their predictive capabilities. Ultimately, the project aims to develop a robust predictive model that aids in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, potentially improving patient outcomes and treatment strategies.
